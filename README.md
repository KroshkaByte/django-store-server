## How to run the project

### *Using Docker*
Using Docker
To run the project with Docker, make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/KroshkaByte/store-server.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd store-server
    ```
3. [Configure .env](#environment-configuration)

4. Start the project:
    ```
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

### *Deploying Locally*


Before starting the project setup, ensure that you have the following installed and running on your machine:

>- **Redis**: This project utilizes Redis as a message broker. Ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://redis.io/).
>- **PostgreSQL**: The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. Install and configure PostgreSQL on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).
>- **Stripe CLI**: The quickest way to develop and test webhooks locally is with the Stripe CLI.

As a first step, follow the install guide for [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

Once you have the Stripe CLI installed and have completed the login process, youâ€™re ready to move on to the next step.

After installing Stripe CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/stripe/
   ```
Save the webhook signing secret that is output in the terminal:
   ```
   Your webhook signing secret is whsec_ ... (^C to quit)
   ```
Store this secret in your `.env` file as the variable `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

**Important**: Each time you run the command `stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/stripe/`, 
the webhook signing secret **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** will change. 
___
#### Environment Configuration
You need to manually update this secret in your `.env` file each time it changes.

Additionally, create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.example` or `.env.docker-example`. Fill in your own data and rename the file to `.env`.

Please note that the Django secret key used in the `.env.example` or `.env.docker-example` is just an example. You can generate a new key using the following command:

   ```
   from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
   
   print(get_random_secret_key())
   ```
Once you have Redis, PostgreSQL, Stripe CLI, and your .env file set up, proceed with the following steps to run the project:
___
**Setting Up and Running in a Virtual Environment**

Ensure that your machine has the latest version of **Python** installed (tested with version 3.12).

1. Clone the repository onto the machine from which the service will be run:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/KroshkaByte/store-server.git
    ```

2. Set up a **Python** virtual environment in the project directory:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment for **Linux/Unix**:

    ```
    source ./venv/bin/activate 
    ```

   For **Windows**, ensure that script execution is allowed in **Powershell**:

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. With the virtual environment activated, install the required components:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables following the example in the `.env.sample` file.

6. Execute migrations (from the virtual environment):

    ```
    .\manage.py migrate
    ```
7. (Optional) Load sample data for preview:
    ```
   ./manage.py loaddata products/fixtures/categories.json && ./manage.py loaddata products/fixtures/products.json
    ```
8. Run Celery:
   ```
   celery -A store worker -l INFO
   ```

9. Run the project:

    ```
    .\manage.py runserver
    ```

   The test server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost/8000/`.

10. To create a superuser, execute the following command (from the virtual environment) and follow the prompts:

    ```
    python .\manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
___
## Testing

To run the tests, run the following command:
   ```
   ./manage.py test . 
   ```
