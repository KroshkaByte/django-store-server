## How to run the project

### *Using Docker*
Using Docker
To run the project with Docker, make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KroshkaByte/store-server.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd store-server
    ```
3. [Configure .env](#environment-configuration)

4. Start the project:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

### *Deploying Locally*


Before starting the project setup, ensure that you have the following installed and running on your machine:

>- **Redis**: This project utilizes Redis as a message broker. Ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://redis.io/).
>- **PostgreSQL**: The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. Install and configure PostgreSQL on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).
>- **Stripe CLI**: The quickest way to develop and test webhooks locally is with the Stripe CLI.

As a first step, follow the install guide for [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

Once you have the Stripe CLI installed and have completed the login process, youâ€™re ready to move on to the next step.

After installing Stripe CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/stripe/
   ```
Save the webhook signing secret that is output in the terminal:
   ```sh
   Your webhook signing secret is whsec_ ... (^C to quit)
   ```
Store this secret in your `.env` file as the variable `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

**Important**: Each time you run the command `stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/stripe/`, 
the webhook signing secret **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** will change. 

### *Deploying to VPS*

To deploy the project to your VPS (Virtual Private Server), follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Set Up Stripe Integration and Register Webhook**: Before deployment, ensure you have configured Stripe for handling payments. Visit [Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/) to set up Stripe integration and obtain necessary API keys and secrets. After deploying your event handler endpoint to production, register your live URL with Stripe. Follow the guide to register a webhook [here](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#register-webhook).

3. **Check Docker Availability**: Ensure Docker is installed on your VPS. If Docker is not installed, follow the instructions to install it:

    - For Ubuntu:
      ```sh
      docker --version
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install docker.io
      ```
   - For other operating systems, refer to [Docker's](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) official installation documentation.

4. **Set Up Domain Name and SSL**: Configure your domain name to point to your VPS IP address. Additionally, set up SSL certificates to enable secure HTTPS connections. Modify the `nginx.conf` file included in the project to use your domain name and SSL certificates.

   - For example, you can refer to [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-22-04) for obtaining a security certificate and domain binding.

5. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**: Modify the `main.yml` file in your forked repository to suit your environment and deployment preferences. Ensure it includes necessary steps like installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying to your VPS.

6. **Add Secrets**: In your GitHub repository settings, add any necessary secrets such as database credentials, API keys, or environment variables needed for deployment. These secrets will be securely passed to your CI/CD pipeline during deployment. 

   - For example, you can refer to this [tutorial](https://dev.to/knowbee/how-to-setup-continuous-deployment-of-a-website-on-a-vps-using-github-actions-54im) for setting up continuous deployment using GitHub Actions.

7. **Push Changes to Main Branch**: Once your CI/CD pipeline is configured and secrets are added, push your changes to the main branch of your forked repository. This will trigger the deployment process to your VPS.


___
#### Environment Configuration
You need to manually update this secret in your `.env` file each time it changes.

Additionally, create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.example` or `.env.docker-example`. Fill in your own data and rename the file to `.env`.

Please note that the Django secret key used in the `.env.example` or `.env.docker-example` is just an example. You can generate a new key using the following command:

   ```sh
   from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
   
   print(get_random_secret_key())
   ```
Once you have Redis, PostgreSQL, Stripe CLI, and your .env file set up, proceed with the following steps to run the project:
___
**Setting Up and Running in a Virtual Environment**

Ensure that your machine has the latest version of **Python** installed (tested with version 3.12).

1. Clone the repository onto the machine from which the service will be run:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KroshkaByte/store-server.git
    ```

2. Set up a **Python** virtual environment in the project directory:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment for **Linux/Unix**:

    ```sh
    source ./venv/bin/activate 
    ```

   For **Windows**, ensure that script execution is allowed in **Powershell**:

    ```sh
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. With the virtual environment activated, install the required components:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables following the example in the `.env.sample` file.

6. Execute migrations (from the virtual environment):

    ```sh
    .\manage.py migrate
    ```
7. (Optional) Load sample data for preview:
    ```sh
   ./manage.py loaddata products/fixtures/categories.json && ./manage.py loaddata products/fixtures/products.json
    ```
8. Run Celery:
   ```sh
   celery -A store worker -l INFO
   ```

9. Run the project:

    ```sh
    .\manage.py runserver
    ```

   The test server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost/8000/`.

10. To create a superuser, execute the following command (from the virtual environment) and follow the prompts:

    ```sh
    python .\manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
___
